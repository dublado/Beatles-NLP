words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
they slither while they pass they slip away across the universe
pools of sorrow waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
possessing and caressing me

nothing's gonna change my world
nothing's gonna change my world
nothing's gonna change my world
nothing's gonna change my world
images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
they call me on and on across the universe
thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
they tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe
jai guru deva om
nothing's gonna change my world
nothing's gonna change my world
nothing's gonna change my world
nothing's gonna change my world
sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing
through my open ears inciting and inviting me
limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
and calls me on and on across the universe

sunrise doesn't last all morning 
a cloudburst doesn't last all day 
seems my love is up 
and has left you with no warning
it's not always been this grey
all things must pass 
all things must pass away
sunset doesn't last all evening 
a mind can blow those clouds away 
after all this my love is up 
and must be leaving 
it has not always been this grey
all things must pass 
all things must pass away
all things must pass 
none of life's strings can last 
so I must be on my way 
face another day
darkness only stays at nighttime 
in the morning it will fade away 
daylight is good 
at arriving at the right time 
it's not always 
will to be this grey
all things must pass 
all things must pass away 
all things must pass 
all things must pass away

your day breaks your mind aches
you find that all the words of kindness linger on
when she no longer needs you
she wakes up she makes up
she takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
she no longer needs you
and in her eyes you see nothing
no sign of love behind the tears
cried for no one
a love that should have lasted years
you want her you need her
and yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead

cried for no one
a love that should have lasted years

she says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone
she doesn't need him
your day breaks your mind aches
there will be times when all the things she said will fill your head
you won't forget her
and in her eyes you see nothing
no sign of love behind the tears
cried for no one
a love that should have lasted years

is it for her or myself that I cry
i'm a loser
and I lost someone who's near to me
i'm a loser

all my life though some have changed
some forever not for better
some have gone and some remain
all these places have their moments
with lovers and friends I still can recall
some are dead and some are living
in my life I've loved them all
but of all these friends and lovers
there is no one compares with you
and these memories lose their meaning
when I think of love as something new
though I know I'll never lose affection
for people and things that went before
i know I'll often stop and think about them
in my life I love you more

lovely rita meter maid
nothing can come between us
when it gets dark I tow your heart away
standing by a parking meter
when I caught a glimpse of rita
filling in a ticket in her little white book
in a cap she looked much older
and the bag across her shoulder
made her look a little like a military man
lovely rita meter maid
may I inquire discreetly
when are you free to take some tea with me
rita
took her out and tried to win her
had a laugh and over dinner
told her I would really like to see her again
got the bill and rita paid it
took her home I nearly made it
sitting on the sofa with a sister or two
oh lovely rita meter maid
where would I be without you
give us a wink and make me think of you
picture yourself in a boat on a river
with tangerine trees and marmalade skies
somebody calls you you answer quite slowly
a girl with kaleidoscope eyes
cellophane flowers of yellow and green
towering over your head
look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
and she's gone
lucy in the sky with diamonds
lucy in the sky with diamonds
lucy in the sky with diamonds
ah
follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
that grow so incredibly high
newspaper taxis appear on the shore
waiting to take you away
climb in the back with your head in the clouds
and you're gone
lucy in the sky with diamonds
lucy in the sky with diamonds
lucy in the sky with diamonds
ah
picture yourself on a train in a station
with plasticine porters with looking glass ties
suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
the girl with the kaleidoscope eyes
lucy in the sky with diamonds
lucy in the sky with diamonds
lucy in the sky with diamonds
ah
lucy in the sky with diamonds
lucy in the sky with diamonds

when I think of things we did it makes me want to cry
were you telling lies ah the night before
was I so unwise ah the night before
when I held you near you were so sincere
treat me like you did the night before
like the night before
this happened once before
when I came to your door
no reply
they said it wasn't you
but I saw you peep through
your window
i saw the light
i saw the light
i know that you saw me
'cause I looked up to see
your face
i tried to telephone
they said you were not home
that's a lie
'cause I know where you've been
and I saw you walk in
your door
i nearly died
i nearly died
'cause you walked hand in hand
with another man
in my place
if I were you I'd realize that i
love you more than any other guy
and I'll forgive the lies that i
heard before when you gave me no reply
i tried to telephone
they said you were not home
that's a lie
'cause I know where you've been
and I saw you walk in
your door
i nearly died
i nearly died
'cause you walked hand in hand
with another man
in my place
no reply
no reply
i once had a girl
or should I say she once had me
she showed me her room
isn't it good norwegian wood
she asked me to stay
and she told me to sit anywhere
so I looked around
and I noticed there wasn't a chair
i sat on a rug biding my time
drinking her wine
we talked until two and then she said
"it's time for bed"
she told me she worked
in the morning and started to laugh
i told her I didn't
and crawled off to sleep in the bath
and when I awoke I was alone
this bird had flown
so I lit a fire
isn't it good norwegian wood
you know you made me cry
i see no use in wond'ring why
i cried for you
and now you've changed your mind
i see no reason to change mine
i cried it's through oh
oh you're giving me the same old line
i'm wond'ring why
you hurt me then you're back again
no no not a second time
not guilty 
for getting in your way 
while you're trying to steal the day 
not guilty 
and I'm not here for the rest 
i'm not trying to steal your vest
i am not trying to be smart 
i only want what I can get 
i'm really sorry for your ageing head 
but like you heard me said 
not guilty
no use handing me a writ 
while I'm trying to do my bit
i don't expect to take your heart 
i only want what I can get 
i'm really sorry that you're underfed 
but like you heard me said 
not guilty
not guilty 
for looking like a freak 
making friends with every sikh 
not guilty 
for leading you astray 
on the road to mandalay
i won't upset the apple cart 
i only want what I can get 
i'm really sorry that you've been misled 
but like you heard me said 
not guilty

i want a love that's right 
but right is only half of what's wrong
i want a short haired girl 
who sometimes wears it twice as long
now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe
baby I'm in love with you
i'm so glad you came here it won't be the same now
i'm telling you
you know you pick me up 
from where some try to drag me down
and when I see your smile 
replace every thoughtless frown
got me escaping from this zoo
baby I'm in love with you
i'm so glad you came here it won't be the same now 
when I'm with you
if I grow up I'll be a singer 
wearing rings on every finger
not worrying what they or you say 
i'll live and love and maybe someday
who knows baby you may comfort me
i may appear to be imperfect
my love is something you can't reject
i'm changing faster than the weather 
if you and me should get together
who knows baby you may comfort me
i want that love of yours
to miss that love is something I'd hate
i'll make an early start
i'm making sure that I'm not late
for you sweet top lip I'm in the queue
baby I'm in love with you
i'm so glad you came here it won't be the same now 
when I'm with you
i'm so glad you came here it won't be the same now 
when I'm with you

if you're listening to this song
you may think the chords are going wrong
but they're not
we just wrote them like that
if you're listening late at night
you may think the band are not quite right
but they are
the just play it like that
and it doesn't really matter what chords I play
what words I say
or time of day it is
as it's only a northern song
it doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
what words I pair
or if my hair is brown
'cause it's only a northern song
if you think the harmony
is a little dull and out of key
you're correct
'cause there's nobody there
and it's only there's no one there

penny lane there is a barber showing photographs
of every head he's had the pleasure to know
and all the people that come and go
stop and say "hello"
on the corner is a banker with a motorcar
and little children laugh at him behind his back
and the banker never wears a mac
in the pouring rain very strange
penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
there beneath the blue suburban skies
i sit and meanwhile back
in penny lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
and in his pocket is a portrait of the queen
he likes to keep his fire engine clean
it's a clean machine
penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
a four of fish and finger pies
in summer meanwhile back
behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
the pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
and though she feels as if she's in a play
she is anyway
in penny lane the barber shaves another customer
we see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
and then the fireman rushes in
from the pouring rain - very strange
penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
there beneath the blue suburban skies
i sit and meanwhile back
penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
there beneath the blue suburban skies
penny lane
have you seen the little piggies 
crawling in the dirt
and for all the little piggies
life is getting worse
always having dirt to play around in
have you seen the bigger piggies
in their starched white shirts
you will find the bigger piggies
stirring up the dirt
always have clean shirts to play around in
in their styes with all their backing
they don't care what goes on around
in their eyes there's something lacking
what they need's a damn good whacking
everywhere there's lots of piggies
living piggy lives
you can see them out for dinner 
with their piggy wives
clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon

if the rain comes 
they run and hide their heads
they might as well be dead
if the rain comes
if the rain comes
when the sun shines 
they slip into the shade
and sip their lemonade
when the sun shines

rain I don't mind
shine the weather's fine
i can show you 
that when it starts to rain
everything's the same
i can show you

now somewhere in the black mountain hills of dakota
there lived a young boy named rocky raccoon
and one day his woman ran off with another guy
hit young rocky in the eye
rocky didn't like that
he said "i'm gonna get that boy"
so one day he walked into town
booked himself a room in the local saloon
rocky raccoon checked into his room
only to find gideon's bible
rocky had come equipped with a gun
to shoot off the legs of his rival
his rival it seems had broken his dreams
by stealing the girl of his fancy
her name was magill and she called herself lil
but everyone knew her as nancy
now she and her man who called himself dan
were in the next room at the hoe down
rocky burst in and grinning a grin
he said "danny boy this is a showdown"
but daniel was hot he drew first and shot
and rocky collapsed in the corner
now the doctor came in stinking of gin
and proceeded to lie on the table
he said "rocky you met your match"
and rocky said "doc it's only a scratch
and I'll be better I'll be better doc as soon as I am able"
now rocky raccoon he fell back in his room
only to find gideon's bible
gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
to help with good rocky's revival
well I'd rather see you dead little girl
than to be with another man
you better keep your head little girl
or you won't know where I am
you better run for your life if you can little girl
hide your head in the sand little girl
catch you with another man
that's the end'a little girl
well you know that I'm a wicked guy
and I was born with a jealous mind
and I can't spend my whole life
trying just to make you toe the line
you better run for your life if you can little girl

catch you with another man
that's the end'a little girl

by the banks of her own lagoon

wednesday morning at five o'clock
as the day begins
silently closing her bedroom door
leaving the note that she hoped would say more
she goes downstairs to the kitchen
clutching her handkerchief
quietly turning the backdoor key
stepping outside she is free
shewe gave her most of our lives
is leaving sacrificed most of our lives
home we gave her everything money could buy
she's leaving home after living alone for so many years bye bye
father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
picks up the letter that's lying there
standing alone at the top of the stairs
she breaks down and cries to her husband
"daddy our baby's gone
"why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
how could she do this to me"
she we never thought of ourselves
is leaving never a thought for ourselves
home we struggled hard all our lives to get by
she's leaving home after living alone for so many years
friday morning at nine o'clock
she is far away
waiting to keep the appointment she made
meeting a man from the motortrade
she what did we do that was wrong
is having we didn't know it was wrong
fun fun is the one thing that money can't buy
something inside that was always denied for so many years
she's leaving home bye bye
something in the way she moves
attracts me like no other lover
something in the way she woos me
i don't want to leave her now
you know I believe and how
somewhere in her smile she knows
that I don't need no other lover
something in her style that shows me
don't want to leave her now
you know I believe and how
you're asking me will my love grow
i don't know I don't know
you stick around now it may show
i don't know I don't know
something in the way she knows
and all I have to do is think of her
something in the things she shows me
don't want to leave her now
you know I believe and how
step inside love and stay
step inside love
step inside love

and kiss me tonight

a friend says that your love won't mean a lot
and you know that your love is all you've got
at times things are so fine and at times they're not
but when she says she loves you that means a lot
a friend says that a love is never true
but you know that this don't apply to you
a touch can mean so much when it's all you've got
and when she says she loves you that means a lot
love can be deep inside love can be suicide
can't you see you can't hide what you feel when it's real
a friend says that your love won't mean a lot
but you know that your love is all you've got
a touch can mean so much when it's all you've got

there is a place
where I can go
when I feel low
when I feel blue
and it's my mind
and there's no time when I'm alone
i think of you
and things you do
go 'round my head
the things you said
like "i love only you"
in my mind there's no sorrow
don't you know that it's so
there'll be no sad tomorrow
don't you know that it's so
there is a place
where I can go
when I feel low
when I feel blue
and it's my mind
and there's no time when I'm alone
there's a place
you say you will love me 
if I have to go 
you'll be thinking of me
somehow I will know 
wishing you weren't so far away
then I will remember 
the things we said today
you say you'll be mine girl
until the end of time 
these days such a kind girl 
seems so hard to find 
someday when we're dreaming
deep in love not a lot to say 
then we will try to remember 
the things we said today
me I'm just the lucky kind 
love to hear you say that love is luck 
and though we may be blind
love is here to stay and that's enough 
to make you mine girl
be the only one 
love me all the time girl 
we'll go on and on 
someday when we're dreaming
deep in love not a lot to say 
then we will try to remember 
the things we said today
love me all the time girl 
we'll go on and on 
someday when we're dreaming
deep in love not a lot to say 
then we will try to remember 
the things we said today
i've got a word or two
to say about the things that you do
you're telling all those lies
about the good things that we can have
if we close our eyes
do what you want to do
and go where you're going to
think for yourself
cause I won't be there with you
i left you far behind
the ruins of the life that you had in mind
and though you still can't see
i know your mind's made up
you're gonna cause more misery
do what you want to do
and go where you're going to
think for yourself
cause I won't be there with you
although your mind's opaque
try thinking more if just for your own sake
the future still looks good
and you've got time to rectify
all the things that you should
do what you want to do
and go where you're going to
think for yourself
cause I won't be there with you
do what you want to do
and go where you're going to
think for yourself
cause I won't be there with you
think for yourself
cause I won't be there with you
that boy
took my love away
he'll regret it someday

just to love you but oh my

turn off your mind relax and float down stream
it is not dying it is not dying
lay down all thoughts surrender to the void
it is shining it is shining
yet you may see the meaning of within
it is being it is being
love is all and love is everyone
it is knowing it is knowing
 that ignorance and hates may mourn the dead
it is believing it is believing
but listen to the colour of your dreams
it is not living it is not living
so play the game "existence" to the end
 of the beginning of the beginning
of the beginning of the beginning
of the beginning of the beginning
of the beginning of the beginning
two of us riding nowhere
spending someone's
hard earned pay
two of us sunday driving
not arriving
on our way back home

on my wall
you and me burning matches
lifting latches
on our way back home

two of us wearing raincoats
standing so low
in the sun
you and me chasing paper
getting nowhere
on our way back home
we're on our way home

and if your heart's strong
hold on I won't delay
wait till I come back to your side

and know that you
will wait for me

while you see it your way
run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone
we can work it out

for fussing and fighting my friend
i have always thought that it's a crime

what goes on in your heart
what goes on in your mind
you are tearing me apart
when you treat me so unkind
what goes on in your mind
the other day I saw you
as I walked along the road

what goes on in your heart
i used to think of no one else
but you were just the same
you didn't even think of me
as someone with a name
did you mean to break my heart and watch me die
tell me why
what goes on in your heart
what goes on in your mind
you are tearing me apart
when you treat me so unkind
what goes on in your mind

what you're doing to me
i've been waiting here for you
wond'ring what you're gonna do

we were talking about the space between us all
and the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
never glimpse the truth then it's far too late when they pass away
we were talking about the love we all could share 
when we find it to try our best to hold it there with our love
with our love we could save the world if they only knew
try to realize it's all within yourself no-one else can make you change
and to see you're really only very small
and life flows on within you and without you
we were talking about the love that's gone so cold
and the people who gain the world and lose their soul
they don't know they can't see are you one of them
when you've seen beyond yourself 
then you may find peace of mind is waiting there
and the time will come when you see we're all one
and life flows on within you and without you
for the other half of the sky
